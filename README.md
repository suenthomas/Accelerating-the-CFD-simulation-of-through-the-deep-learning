# Accelerating-the-CFD-simulation-through-the-deep-learning
# Background 
# Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential tool to simulation. However, it takes too much computational resources include time and hardware, since it takes too long ime for CFD to iterate a accurate result.
# This will delay essential engineering decision that requires short period decision. therefore, this aims to use the deep learmning to accerlerate the CFD simulation
